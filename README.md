# Grammar Autocorrection using T5 Transformer

This project implements an **English Grammar Autocorrection System** using the **Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)** model.  
It fine-tunes the model on the **JFLEG dataset** to automatically correct grammatical and fluency-related errors in English sentences.  
The project also evaluates performance using **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, and **F1-score** metrics.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Applied Natural Language Processing** course.  
It demonstrates how Transformer-based models like **T5** can be adapted for **grammatical error correction (GEC)** tasks.

## Features
- Fine-tuning of the **T5-base** model for grammar correction.  
- Uses **JFLEG**, a benchmark dataset for fluency and grammaticality.  
- Computes **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1**, **BLEU**, and **ROUGE** metrics.  
- Supports **interactive sentence correction** through console input.  
- Beautifully formatted outputs using the **Rich** library.
